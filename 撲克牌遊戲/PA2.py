# Have you ever considered the determinism of a deck of cards? For example,
# suppose the above code had produced:
#  Hand: ['10♠', 'J♠', 'A♥', '2♦', '3♦']
#  Two more cards: ['Q♠', 'K♠']
#
# Such an output reminds if homework #1, where we might have chosen to
# discard the '2♦' and '3♦', thus taking two more cards to finally get:
#     a.10♠  b. J♠  c. A♥  d. Q♠  e. K♠
#
# This is a royal straight, so you decice to not discard any cards. But what
# you then found out that the card on the top of the undealt deck was 'A♠'?
# Knowing this, you would now say that you should have discarded c, to get
# a royal straight flush.
#
# And you are correct that you should have done that, because the order of a
# shuffled deck of cards is predetermined (and so is the order of our shuffled
# list, deckV1, that was created above).
#
# In contrast to deckV1, each of the following decks cards are not determined
# until they are dealt.
